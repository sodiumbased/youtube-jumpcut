00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,060
in this video I want to tackle our

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,920
intuition of electricity and its

3
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,029
physical properties specifically today

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,460
we're going to be talking about current

5
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:11,599
so if I ask you right now what is

6
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,599
current what would you say

7
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,939
a lot of this is a current is the flow

8
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,680
of electrons and that matches really

9
00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:21,349
closely with Imperium definition of

10
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,599
current which is is equal to Q over T or

11
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:28,580
current is equal to the flow of charge

12
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:30,560
over time and I demonstrate in this

13
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:33,140
little circuit we have a battery which

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,329
supplies a voltage and one single wire

15
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,860
which closes the loop now a lot of us

16
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:38,540
I've seen animations like this that even

17
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,309
been described as electrons pushing each

18
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,350
other from one end to the other but that

19
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:43,940
raises the question we've all asked what

20
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,379
if we have a six million kilometer long

21
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,000
wire and we ran a current through that

22
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:48,140
what the electrons would push each other

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,469
all the way to the other side

24
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:53,030
for eternity well maybe not all of us

25
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:54,890
have questioned that but that leaves us

26
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,210
wondering if electrons are too slow to

27
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:58,789
transfer the information in current

28
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:00,589
carrying wire what does the answer that

29
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:02,300
question is electric field but first

30
00:01:00,589 --> 00:01:04,129
we're going to talk about drift velocity

31
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,590
now a lot of us have heard about your

32
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:08,090
philosophy class and what it is is the

33
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,440
speed at which a charge carrier moves

34
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,659
from one end of the circuit to the other

35
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,310
in this circuit it could take up to an

36
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:14,330
hour for an electron to transfer from

37
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,280
the negative terminal to the positive

38
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:18,080
terminal now something doesn't add up

39
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,120
here because our internet speeds are

40
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,070
much faster than that and it's more like

41
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,530
in the nanoseconds the transfer

42
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:26,930
something from here to here so how does

43
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,340
information energy travel from one end

44
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:31,310
of the current carrying wire to another

45
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:33,560
I've been analogy for this is the water

46
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:35,360
hose and this water hose assuming is

47
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,860
filled with water can be treated like a

48
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,510
current carrying wire with the water

49
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,970
decided being like the electrons in the

50
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:43,250
wire so if you were to put this on

51
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:45,380
faucet and crank up the pressure the

52
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,870
pressure waves would propagate through

53
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,000
the hose to the other end before the

54
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,620
wonderful fits dude the water molecule

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,720
here doesn't have to travel all the way

56
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:55,100
around to come out the other side the

57
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,440
pressure which travels at the speed of

58
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,390
sound propagates the information to the

59
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,520
other side of the hose for this water

60
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:03,620
molecule to come out and that's exactly

61
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,760
how a wire works and in a

62
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,210
current-carrying wire instead of

63
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,860
pressure

64
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,840
we have electric fields and those

65
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,610
propagate at the speed of light or

66
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,260
almost the speed of light and that

67
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:15,050
carries the information for the

68
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:17,000
electrons further down the wire to move

69
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:19,520
another question might have asked is

70
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,739
about capacitors now we know a parallel

71
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,170
plate capacitor there are no conductors

72
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:25,760
in between to carry charges therefore

73
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:28,459
according to the appearing definition of

74
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,810
current there is no current however

75
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:31,400
there is something called displacement

76
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,020
currents and that has to do with the

77
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,640
electric field so it's really

78
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,680
interesting to see how electric fields

79
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,510
and charge is very important for example

80
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,680
in chemistry we want to count for every

81
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,180
single charges flowing through the

82
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,190
circuit let's say in a battery

83
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,540
whereas in signal processing we want to

84
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,250
make sure that Layton sees as well as

85
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,530
possible and therefore we calculate the

86
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,000
permeability of the electric field I

87
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,680
want to end the video by reminding you

88
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,940
to never stop question deeper and for

89
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,739
those of you who already thought a step

90
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,870
ahead and asking how electric fields

91
00:02:54,739 --> 00:03:00,250
properly information to space well honey

92
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,250
physicists have an explanation for you
